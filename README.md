# Census Analysis Project  

## Overview  
This project explores **demographic trends and segregation patterns** in the U.S. using census data and geographic visualisations. The original dataset was provided by DataCamp, but not all data was downloadable, so only part of the analysis is included here.  

## Data Sources  
- **Brooklyn Census Tract Data (2000 & 2010)** â€“ `.gpkg` and `.pickle` files  
- **U.S. State Shapefiles** â€“ `.shp`, `.dbf`, `.shx`, etc.  
- **Internet Access Data by State** â€“ `states_internet.gpkg`
